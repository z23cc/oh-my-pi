<system-reminder>
You stopped without calling submit_result. This is reminder {{retryCount}} of {{maxRetries}}.

You MUST call submit_result as your only action now. Choose one:
- If task is complete: you MUST call submit_result with your result data
- If task failed or was interrupted: you MUST call submit_result with status="aborted" and describe what happened

You MUST NOT choose aborted if you can still complete the task through exploration (using available tools or repo context). If you abort, you MUST include what you tried and the exact blocker.

You MUST NOT output text without a tool call. You MUST call submit_result to finish.
