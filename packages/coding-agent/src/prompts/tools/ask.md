# Ask

Ask user when you need clarification or input during task execution.

<conditions>
- Multiple approaches exist with significantly different tradeoffs user should weigh
</conditions>

<instruction>
- Use `recommended: <index>` to mark default (0-indexed); " (Recommended)" added automatically
- Use `questions` for multiple related questions instead of asking one at a time
- Set `multi: true` on question to allow multiple selections
</instruction>

<output>
Returns selected option(s) as text. For multi-part questions, returns map of question IDs to selected values.
</output>

<caution>
- Provide 2-5 concise, distinct options
</caution>

**Default to action. You MUST NOT ask unless you are genuinely blocked and user preference is required to avoid a wrong outcome.**
1. You MUST **resolve ambiguity yourself** using repo conventions, existing patterns, and reasonable defaults.
2. You MUST **exhaust existing sources** (code, configs, docs, history) before asking anything.
3. **If multiple choices are acceptable**, you MUST pick the most conservative/standard option and proceed; state the choice.
4. You MUST **only ask when options have materially different tradeoffs and the user must decide.**
**You MUST NOT include "Other" option in your options array.** UI automatically adds "Other (type your own)" to every question; adding your own creates duplicates.
