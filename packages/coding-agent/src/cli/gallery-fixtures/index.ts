/**
 * Aggregated sample data for the `omp gallery` command.
 *
 * Each fixture drives one tool's renderer through the four lifecycle states the
 * gallery showcases: arguments streaming in, arguments complete but awaiting a
 * result, a successful result, and a failed result. The data is intentionally
 * hand-written (rather than schema-derived) so the gallery reflects what a real
 * tool call looks like — the whole point is visual QA of the renderers.
 *
 * Fixtures are grouped by subsystem into sibling modules and merged here.
 * Adding a tool to one of those groups is enough for the gallery to render it.
 * Tools present in the renderer registry but missing here fall back to a
 * generic fixture (see `gallery-cli.ts`), so the gallery never crashes on a
 * newly added tool — it just looks plain until a fixture is supplied.
