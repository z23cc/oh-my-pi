/**
 * Regression for https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1606
 *
 * On Windows, `onnxruntime-node`'s NAPI finalizer segfaults Bun during
 * shutdown after `@huggingface/transformers` has loaded a tiny model in a
 * Worker thread. The agent used to host the tiny-model worker as a Worker
 * inside its own process; tearing the worker down ran the native destructor
 * in the parent's address space and crashed the CLI on exit.
 *
 * The fix relocates the worker to a child process: `title-client.ts` spawns
 * `process.execPath … --tiny-worker`, `cli.ts` dispatches that flag into
 * `runTinyWorker`, and the parent `SIGKILL`s the child on dispose so the
 * native finalizer never runs in either address space. These tests pin the
 * three pieces of that contract so a future refactor cannot quietly land
 * the original crash again.
