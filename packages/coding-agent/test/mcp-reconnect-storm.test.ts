/**
 * Regression test for issue #1592: an MCP stdio server that exits immediately
 * after completing initialize + tools/list must not trigger an unbounded
 * respawn loop.
 *
 * The reporter's agent forked 66 487 PHP child processes in ~7 minutes
 * (~158 spawns/sec) before macOS force-rebooted. The crashing fixture below
 * models that pathology: each spawn answers the handshake and exits cleanly,
 * which fires `transport.onClose` → `reconnectServer` with no rate limiter
 * in the unpatched build.
 *
 * The contract this test defends: per-server crash bursts are capped so that
 * even a fast-crashing stdio server stays well below the OS process budget.
