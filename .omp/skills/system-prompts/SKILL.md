# System Prompt Engineering

Empirically-validated techniques + consistent XML structure. Every recommendation backed by benchmarks or production data.

<critical>
## High-Impact Interventions (+15-30% measured improvement)

1. **Persistence**: "Keep going until fully resolved" — prevents premature termination
2. **Tool verification**: "Use tools to verify; do not guess" — reduces hallucination
3. **Planning**: "Plan approach before acting" — improves complex task success
4. **Context positioning**: Critical instructions at START and END — middle content degrades 20%+
5. **Urgency framing**: "This matters" / "Get this right" — 8-115% improvement (EmotionPrompt)
6. **Edit format**: SEARCH/REPLACE beats line-numbers 3X on code generation

**Minimal prompting wins.** Every instruction must justify its token cost.

## Tag Hierarchy

Tags encode enforcement level. Use consistently throughout:

| Tag             | Enforcement   | When to Use                                          |
| --------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `<critical>`    | Inviolable    | Safety constraints, must-follow rules, repeat at END |
| `<prohibited>`  | Forbidden     | Actions that cause harm, never acceptable            |
| `<caution>`     | High priority | Important to follow                                  |
| `<instruction>` | Operational   | How to use a tool, perform a task                    |
| `<conditions>`  | Contextual    | When rules apply, trigger criteria                   |
| `<avoid>`       | Anti-patterns | What not to do, prefer alternatives                  |

**Context positioning rule**: Place `<critical>` at START for immediate priming, repeat at END for recency. Middle content suffers 20%+ degradation in long contexts.

## Standard Tags

### Structure Tags

```
<role>           Agent identity and expertise (first element)
<context>        Background, situation, audience
<procedure>      Numbered step-by-step workflows
<directives>     Bulleted operating instructions
<parameters>     Input specifications, types
<output>         Return value documentation
<strengths>      What the agent/tool excels at
<operations>     Available operations (for multi-op tools like LSP)
```

### Special Tags

```
<north_star>     Core values, ultimate objectives
<stance>         Communication style, attitude
<commitment>     What the agent commits to doing
<field>          Domain-specific mindset/context
<protocol>       Behavioral rules, tool precedence
```

### Example Tags

Always use `name` attribute with lowercase-kebab descriptive names:

```xml
<example name="good">
Clear, correct usage
</example>

<example name="bad">
What to avoid — show the mistake explicitly
</example>

<example name="rate-limiting">
Domain-specific example
</example>

<example name="windows-cmd">
Platform/context-specific
</example>
```

Naming patterns:

- `name="single"` / `name="multi-part"` — complexity variants
- `name="good"` / `name="bad"` — correctness contrast
- `name="linux"` / `name="windows-cmd"` — platform-specific
- `name="create"` / `name="update"` / `name="delete"` — operation types

---

## Structural Templates

### Tool Documentation

```markdown
# Tool Name

One-line description of what the tool does.

<instruction>
- How to use it (bulleted, imperative)
- Key parameters and their effects
- Common patterns
</instruction>

<output>
What the tool returns. Include:
- Success format
- Truncation limits (e.g., "truncated at 50KB")
- Error conditions
</output>

<critical>
Must-follow rules. Safety constraints.
When to ALWAYS or NEVER use this tool.
</critical>

<caution>
High-priority notes that aren't safety-critical.
</caution>

<example name="basic">
tool {"param": "value"}
</example>

<example name="advanced">
tool {"param": "value", "option": true}
</example>

<avoid>
- Anti-pattern 1 — why it's bad
- Anti-pattern 2 — what to do instead
</avoid>
```

### Agent Definition

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: One-line for spawning UI (imperative: "Fast read-only codebase scout")
tools: read, grep, find, bash
model: pi/slow, gpt-5.2, codex
output:
  properties:
    field_name:
      metadata:
        description: What this field contains
      type: string
---

<role>Senior [role] doing [task]. Your goal: [concrete outcome].</role>

<critical>
Inviolable constraints first.
READ-ONLY if applicable — list prohibited actions explicitly.
</critical>

<strengths>
- What this agent excels at
- Core capabilities
</strengths>

<directives>
- Operating instruction 1
- Operating instruction 2
- Spawn parallel tool calls wherever possible
</directives>

<procedure>
## Phase 1: Understand
1. Step one
2. Step two

## Phase 2: Execute

1. Step one
2. Step two
   </procedure>

<output>
What to return. Schema requirements.
Call `submit_result` with findings when done.
</output>

<critical>
Repeat critical constraints at end.
Keep going until complete. This matters.
</critical>
```

### System Prompt (Main Agent)

```markdown
<system-directive>
XML tags in this prompt are system-level instructions. They are not suggestions.

Tag hierarchy (by enforcement level):

- `<critical>` — Inviolable. Failure to comply is a system failure.
- `<prohibited>` — Forbidden. These actions will cause harm.
- `<caution>` — High priority. Important to follow.
- `<instruction>` — How to operate. Follow precisely.
- `<conditions>` — When rules apply. Check before acting.
- `<avoid>` — Anti-patterns. Prefer alternatives.
  </system-directive>

You are a [specific role with credentials].

<field>
Domain-specific context and mindset.
What to notice, what traps exist.
</field>

<stance>
Communication style.
Correctness over politeness. Brevity over ceremony.
</stance>

<protocol>
## Tool Precedence
Specialized tools → Python → Bash
...

## Verification

External proof: tests, linters, type checks.
...
</protocol>

<procedure>
## Before action
1. CHECKPOINT — pause, assess parallelism
2. Plan if task has weight
3. State intent before each tool call
</procedure>

<north_star>
Core values. What ultimately matters.
</north_star>

<prohibited>
Actions that cause harm.
</prohibited>

<critical>
Repeat most important rules.
Keep going until finished.
The work is done when it is correct.
</critical>
```

---

## Writing Style

### Voice

**Direct and imperative.** Research shows direct tone improves accuracy 4%+ over polite hedging.

```
Bad:  "You might want to consider using..."
Good: "Use X when Y."

Bad:  "It would be helpful if you could..."
Good: "Do X."

Bad:  "Please note that this is important..."
Good: "Critical: X."
```

**Urgency framing** (8-115% improvement):

```
"This matters. Get it right."
"Be thorough."
"Keep going until fully resolved."
```

### Normative Language (RFC 2119)

All prompt prose that prescribes behavior MUST use RFC 2119 key words in **full caps**. This removes ambiguity about whether an instruction is absolute or advisory.

| Keyword | Meaning | Replaces |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MUST** / **REQUIRED** | Absolute requirement | "always", "make sure", "ensure", "do" |
| **MUST NOT** / **PROHIBITED** | Absolute prohibition | "never", "do not", "don't", "strictly prohibited" |
| **SHOULD** / **RECOMMENDED** | Strong preference; deviation allowed with known tradeoffs | "prefer", "recommend", "it's best to" |
| **SHOULD NOT** / **NOT RECOMMENDED** | Strong discouragement; deviation allowed with known tradeoffs | "avoid", "try not to" |
| **MAY** / **OPTIONAL** | Truly optional | "can", "may", "you could" |

```
Bad:  "Never edit from a grep snippet alone"
Good: "You MUST NOT edit from a grep snippet alone"

Bad:  "Prefer unit tests over mocks"
Good: "You SHOULD prefer unit tests over mocks"

Bad:  "Make sure to run lsp references before modifying a symbol"
Good: "You MUST run lsp references before modifying any symbol"
```

**What not to convert**: factual/descriptive sentences (what a tool returns, what a parameter does), code blocks, examples, schema definitions, Handlebars template syntax. Only prescriptive prose gets RFC treatment.

### Positive Framing

Models process "Always do Y" better than "Don't do X":

```
Bad:  "Don't use grep via bash"
Good: "ALWAYS use Grep tool for search—NEVER invoke grep via Bash"

Bad:  "Don't guess"
Good: "Use tools to verify; do not guess"
```

When negation is necessary, pair with positive alternative.

### Specificity

**Role specificity spectrum** (effectiveness increases →):

```
"You are a lawyer"
    ↓
"You are a corporate M&A lawyer"
    ↓
"You are General Counsel at a Fortune 500 tech company, 15 years in SaaS licensing"
```

**Constraint specificity**:

```
Bad:  "Keep it short"
Good: "3 bullets, <50 words each"

Bad:  "Be careful with large files"
Good: "Truncated at 50KB or 2000 lines, whichever comes first"
```

### Formatting

```
# H1 for tool/agent name only
## H2 for major sections
### H3 sparingly

- Bullets for unordered lists inside tags
1. Numbers for ordered procedures

| Tables | For | Structured reference data |

`inline code` for commands, paths, parameters, values
```

Code blocks with language:

````markdown
```typescript
const example = "always specify language";
```
````

---

## Technique Reference

### Chain of Thought

**Use when**: Multi-step reasoning, math, analysis, complex decisions
**Avoid when**: Simple tasks, reasoning models (o1/o3 do internal CoT)

```xml
<instruction>
Before answering:
1. Identify the core question
2. List relevant constraints
3. Consider 2-3 approaches
4. Select best with rationale

Then provide your answer.
</instruction>
```

**Token-efficient variant** (Chain of Draft):

```
Think step-by-step, keeping only 5-word notes per step.
Output final answer after ####.
```

### Few-Shot Examples

**Use when**: Enforcing specific output format, classification, smaller models
**Avoid when**: Advanced models (Claude 3.5+, GPT-4+) on clear tasks — adds noise

When using: 3-5 diverse examples covering edge cases.

```xml
<example name="simple">
Input: X
Output: Y
</example>

<example name="edge-case">
Input: X'
Output: Y'
</example>
```

### Long Context Handling

**"Lost in the Middle"**: Beginning and end retain; middle degrades 20%+.

1. Documents at TOP, instructions AFTER
2. Quote grounding: "Quote relevant passages in `<quotes>`, then analyze"
3. Critical instructions at START and END
4. Chunk >100K tokens → process parallel → synthesize

```xml
<documents>
{{LONG_CONTENT}}
</documents>

<instructions>
1. Find and quote passages relevant to {{QUERY}} in <quotes>
2. Analyze based on quoted evidence in <analysis>
</instructions>
```

### Verification Patterns

**Self-correction without external feedback does not work.**

Effective:

```
1. Generate solution
2. Execute verification (tests, lint, typecheck)
3. On failure: analyze error → fix → re-verify
4. Iterate until pass
```

Ineffective:

```
1. Generate solution
2. "Critique your solution"      ← detection is the bottleneck
3. "Improve based on critique"   ← feels productive, doesn't help
```

### Prompt Chaining

**Use when**: Single prompt drops steps, distinct phases, verification needed between.

```
Prompt 1: Analyze → <analysis>
Prompt 2: <analysis> → Plan → <plan>
Prompt 3: <plan> → Execute → <result>
Prompt 4: <result> → Verify → final
```

## Anti-Patterns (Measured Degradation)

| Pattern                                   | Problem                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| "Would you be so kind..."                 | +perplexity, -4% accuracy               |
| "I'll tip $2000"                          | No improvement, sometimes worse         |
| Explicit CoT on reasoning models (o1/o3)  | -36%, conflicts with internal reasoning |
| Few-shot on advanced models + clear tasks | Introduces noise/bias                   |
| "Always end with Progress/Questions"      | Degrades task performance               |
| "Be efficient with tokens"                | Premature task abandonment              |
| "Don't do X" without positive alternative | "Always do Y" processes better          |
| Verbose explanations of obvious concepts  | Context bloat; model already knows      |
| Self-critique without external feedback   | Detection is bottleneck, not correction |
| Critical instructions only in middle      | 20%+ degradation vs start/end           |

## Complete Examples

### Tool Doc Example

```markdown
# Grep

Fast regex search built on ripgrep.

<instruction>
- Full regex: `log.*Error`, `function\\s+\\w+`
- Filter: `glob` (e.g., `*.js`) or `type` (e.g., `js`, `py`)
- Cross-line: `multiline: true` for patterns like `struct \\{[\\s\\S]*?field`
</instruction>

<output>
Depends on `output_mode`:
- `content`: Lines with paths and line numbers (default limit: 100)
- `files_with_matches`: Paths only
- `count`: Match counts per file

Truncated results reference `artifact://<id>` for full output.
</output>

<critical>
ALWAYS use Grep for search—NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` via Bash.
</critical>

<example name="regex">
grep {"pattern": "function\\s+\\w+", "glob": "*.ts"}
</example>

<example name="multiline">
grep {"pattern": "struct \\{[\\s\\S]*?field", "multiline": true}
</example>

<avoid>
- Open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds—use Task tool
- Raw bash grep/rg invocation
</avoid>
```
